            My favourite city is Istanbul!
            The city is the most beautiful place I've travelled to and is
            unique in every way possible. The history goes back more than 1000
            years with influences from the Romans, Byzantine plus Europe, Asia
            and the Middle East during the Ottoman Empire. The culture and
            the food is so mixed and varied it'll make your head spin! Turkey 
            is now a Replublic and a very modern islamic country.
            It is a city where Europe and Asia meet by a
            bridge. You need a minimum of 1 week in Istanbul as there 
            are so many things to do.
            <br></br>
            Istanbul is a city that, quite simply, took my breath away. 
            It is very safe, the food is excellent, the people incredibly 
            friendly and the city rich in history. The typical tourist spots 
            are well worth seeing, particularly the larger Mosques and Ayasofia. 
            If you want to be close to those spots stay in Sultanahmet - mostly smaller,
            boutique hotels that aren't quite as expensive but don't offer the luxury of the larger, 
            business-type hotels around Taksim Square.
